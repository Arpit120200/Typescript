# TypeScript Projects

A collection of small to intermediate TypeScript projects built to gain
hands-on experience with TypeScript fundamentals and real-world patterns.

## Purpose

This repository is designed to strengthen my understanding of TypeScript by
building multiple projects of increasing complexity. Each project focuses on
specific TypeScript concepts such as type safety, generics, union types, and
clean function design.

## Projects

| # | Project Name | Description |
|---|-------------|-------------|
| 01 | Typed To-Do Manager | Task manager with file persistence

## How to Run

Each project is self-contained and can be run independently.

```bash
# Go to Respective Project Folder
cd FileName

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run using ts-node
npx ts-node src/filename.ts
