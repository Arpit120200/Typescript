# TypeScript Projects

A collection of small to intermediate TypeScript projects built to gain
hands-on experience with TypeScript fundamentals and real-world patterns.

## Purpose

This repository is designed to strengthen my understanding of TypeScript by
building multiple projects of increasing complexity. Each project focuses on
specific TypeScript concepts such as type safety, generics, union types, and
clean function design.

## Projects

| # | Project Name | Description |
|---|-------------|-------------|
| 01 | Typed To-Do Manager | Task manager with file persistence
| 02 | Weather Dashboard | Real-time weather fetcher using external APIs.
| 03 | Expense Tracker | Financial logger with calculated balances and data protection.
| 04 | Generic Inventory Management | A reusable warehouse system for different item categories.
| 05 | Typed Quiz Engine | A CLI quiz engine with varying question formats.

## How to Run

Each project is self-contained and can be run independently.
